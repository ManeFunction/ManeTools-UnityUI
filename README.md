# Mane Tools for Unity UI

Custom controls and extensions for Unity UI package (`uGUI`).

// This package is dependent on [ManeTools-dotNET](https://github.com/ManeFunction/ManeTools-dotNet.git).

## Features

- `ColorScheme`

Almost all public API methods are covered with NUnit tests.

## Installation

I recommend installing this package with the `OpenUPM` CLI. It keeps dependencies and updates easy to manage. If you cannot use `OpenUPM`, download the package and place it anywhere in your Unity project.

Setting up `OpenUPM` for the first time takes a few minutes, but it is worth it. `OpenUPM` is the usual registry for open-source Unity packages and works with Unity’s Package Manager (dependency resolution and updates included).

On Windows, I recommend `Git Bash` (`MINGW`) for CLI work: it is a Unix-like shell, and it is often already installed.

1. Install `OpenUPM` (skip this if you already have it):
   - If you do not have `npm`, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (or on macOS: `brew install node`).
   - In a terminal, run: `npm install -g openupm-cli`.
   - You can then install packages from the `OpenUPM` registry with no extra Unity setup.
1. Install this package:
   - Open a terminal in your Unity project folder: `cd /path/to/your/project`.
   - Run: `openupm add com.manefunction.tools-unity-ui`.
   - Switch back to Unity and wait for the package to finish importing.

## Why Preview?

Despite the fact that the code itself is not new, splitting one package into a few - plus a pile of refactoring and migration to the `UI Toolkit` - is a great way to invent fresh bugs.

Overall it should still be safe for commercial work (the original ManeTools already ships in a few dozen live projects), but let's give this split a little time to surface whatever I missed. Use at your own risk, I suppose.
